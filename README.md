# SimplerSpectator
A simple program to spectate & visit the op.gg/lolnexus pages of my friends in games.

_For personal use only, and __does not come with API key.___

_Requires [RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp)._

If you want to compile this, you will need to create a file named riot_key in /SimplerSpectator/ with an API key in plaintext, download [RiotSharp's source](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp) and fix the reference in the SpectatorFunctions project to point to the RiotSharp project.

# Features
- Spectate button to load a player's game
- Op.gg and Lolnexus buttons to quickly visit those pages for a player
- Keeps an editable list of spectated players to easily spectate them without needing to write in their name again
- Detects LOL folder & game version to find the correct .exe to open the spectator client
